# MVP Agent Development Service

## Service Overview

This service turns your idea of an "AI employee" into reality, starting with the most efficient and streamlined version. Cyberk's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Agent Development service focuses on rapidly building a functional agent that solves **one core problem** defined by you.

You provide the vision, title, and domain for the agent. We turn it into a working product, helping you validate your hypothesis and measure real-world value without a large upfront investment.

## Why Start with an MVP Agent?

Starting with an MVP doesn't mean you get a "limited" product. It means you're taking the smartest path to success.

-   **Faster Time-to-Value:** Get your agent up and running, solving a real problem in the shortest amount of time.
-   **Low Initial Cost:** Validate the potential of your idea with a tightly controlled budget.
-   **Validate with Real Data:** Instead of guessing, let the MVP's performance data tell you where to invest next.
-   **Solid Foundation:** The MVP agent is the first, properly built brick, making it easy to scale and evolve into a comprehensive system in the future.

## Streamlined Process

We have optimized our process to focus entirely on speed and efficiency.

1.  **MVP Definition Workshop**
    -   In this workshop, we will collaboratively define: **the single most important task** the agent must accomplish. This is where you officially "give a title" and "assign a domain" to your AI employee.
2.  **Rapid & Transparent Development**
    -   We focus 100% of our resources on building that core feature. You'll get regular demos to see the agent "grow" day by day.
3.  **Controlled Deployment**
    -   We deploy the agent in a controlled environment to start working with real data.
4.  **Review & Roadmap**
    -   Based on the MVP's performance, we will analyze the results together and build a clear development roadmap for future features.
