We have carefully reviewed your documents and Figma designs. It's a highly innovative project! üòä Fortunately, we recently gained some experience with Telegram apps through two projects, Katcafe and Coinseeker, which share quite a few similar features like referral systems and point systems.
We're sending you our proposal on how we would approach the Introlink project, with a brief summary:
Basic Package: 4 months of development at a cost of $11,150/month.
Business Package: 3 months of development at a cost of $14,500/month.
We believe that a team-based, monthly approach is suitable for Intro-Link because it allows us to flexibly add or reduce the scope of work without changing the collaboration agreement. At the same time, you'll have a tight timeline with a fixed cost based on the requirements you've provided.
Let me know what you think! üòä
Hmm, I think we should sell 12k UX/UI Service for design whole the apps + Webs site + all the Contents. Bc 1 UX,UI they lack of skill of Art, Graphic and Motion graphic. Then I think better we should Package UX/UI design as a service. then we can contribule more quality of design.  The cost should be:  
UX/UI Designer:  15k for UX/UI design (Fixxed Cost)  -> 3 month customer Support
Development Cost:   1 Senior dev with SMC skill + 2 Full-stack developer + 1 QA + 1 PM: 15k / month.   (Monthly cost )
UX Service:
1. UX/UI Design with Figma
2. Motion Graphic Design for  Interactive applications design
3. UX Research & final review the productions

Community Development Services
The Challenge:
Building a community from scratch is a daunting task. Even with appealing content, users can quickly lose interest if there are no timely interactions to keep them engaged.
Human Limitations: Limited creativity, cultural differences, and the challenge of ensuring timely responses.
AI Limitations: Issues with quality, accuracy, and intelligence.
Our approach combines AI and human intervention to create proactive interactions that help retain users effectively. By leveraging memes, emojis, and creative comments, we make comment boxes more engaging than ever.
Service Packages:
1. Automation Reply
Automate responses to fan interactions, such as replying to comments, reacting to posts, and engaging with user-generated content.
Why Automation? Ensuring timely and consistent replies is crucial to keeping fans engaged. With automation, you can:
Provide instant feedback to fan comments.
Maintain interaction quality with pre-defined humor or emotional tones.
Save time and resources while building stronger relationships with your audience.
2. Argument Maker (Purposeful Controversy)
Generate intentional debates or discussions within the community.
These carefully crafted arguments create engagement by encouraging fans to actively defend, support, or discuss topics related to their idols or the content.
Designed to foster loyalty and deeper emotional connections between fans and content creators.
3. Interaction Generation
For emerging KOLs or content creators, a quiet comment box can hinder their growth.
This service ensures active and consistent interactions to keep the community alive and thriving.
Implementation Methodology:
AI Learning:
Analyze fan communities of major creators such as PewDiePie, Ninja, or Pokimane on platforms like YouTube and Twitch.
Use insights from these established communities to design high-quality, engaging interactions tailored for your content creators.
Examples include identifying trending meme formats, analyzing humor styles, and observing popular interaction patterns.
Human Supervision:
Admins review or edit AI-generated content before it‚Äôs published.
Option to configure a ‚Äúbypass‚Äù if AI-generated content meets quality standards.
Why Choose Us?
AI and Human Collaboration:
By combining the strengths of both AI and humans, we overcome their respective limitations.
AI generates large-scale, timely interactions, while humans ensure the quality, cultural relevance, and emotional touch of the content.
Cost-Effectiveness:
Creating a large volume of diverse, continuous, and timely content manually is nearly impossible and highly expensive.
Our hybrid approach significantly reduces costs while maintaining a high level of quality and engagement.
Let us help you successfully build and grow your community today! üöÄ
